Instructions for running satellite mask inspection tools

Disclaimer: All codes in this repo and under construction. Some (all?) are poorly documented, and probably not very efficient.

List of files:

  * inspect_sat_masks.py -- main tool in inspect satellite trails created by acstools.findsat_mrt
  * new_diagnostics.py -- codes to create updated trail and image diagnostic plots showing identified trails and their masks
  * update_diagnostics.py -- code to update image and trail diagnostic files to the newest format. Should be run prior to inspecting satellite trails masks
  * config.yaml -- configuration file for inspect_sat_masks.py
